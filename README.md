Huckster is a web application that lets you self-host landing pages for your domain portfolio. It serves up a customizable form so that any potential buyers can leave contact and offer information. Huckster integrates with [Piwik](https://github.com/piwik/piwik) to collect visitor statistics. Huckster can also alert you via SMS when an offer is received.

The overarching principle is to maximize portfolio control and surface relevant data when it becomes actionable.

Huckster can serve large volumes of domain names on low-cost cloud infrastructure. If your portfolio is too small to monetize via parking services and you want to collect analytics while presenting a clear call-to-action to buyers, huckster is probably for you.
